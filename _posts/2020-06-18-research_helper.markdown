Teachers are often tasked with convincing students to use reliable sources. But different teachers have different views on what is reliable. And, it is at the student's discretion to follow the advice of their instructors.

My app brings these issues together to offer a solution that allows students to create research from a limited pool of sources. Search terms feed into two third-party APIs to deliver research from Wikipedia and a variety of more reliable sources. The user can then name a data point and write some paragraphs that explain how the research fits into the overall project. In other words, it's a way of constructing a research paper around its data.
