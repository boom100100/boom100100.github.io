Twitter has a massive pool of data consisting of tweets and collections that they have organized by various categories. Even better, Twitter has made that data available to developers in its own API. Various news sites have a comparable dataset, and they have also exposed that data in numerous APIs. The marriage between these two types of resources is the inspiration for my app, Trending News (TN).

TN is a single page app that pulls trends from Twitter and cross-references those trends with News Api's articles, all in real time. A user of TN may click a button on the GUI index.html page, or make a call directly to the topics and links endpoint to automatically generate trends and articles from the current subset of trends. The end result is a bunch of articles from reputable sources that are related to a specific trend.

Next steps for this app include figuring out how to make it more accessible. The app would be easy to use on a mobile device, but people with disabilities may find the design to be unaccomodating because of the contrast of colors. Sites like https://webaim.org offer resources for discovering and dealing with such problems.

It is also necessary to figure out a billing plan that matches likely usage for third-party APIs.
