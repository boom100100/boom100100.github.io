A very short description of the software development curriculum is that students learn how to write programs that can run locally. Then, students learn to set up a frontend and a backend for a website using common technologies related to Ruby and JavaScript. There is also a strong emphasis on web technologies like RESTful routing and API serving and requesting.

While the bootcamp only has to go so far to teach web development principles, there is more out there. Other ways to present programs include creating platform-specific applications. These are not web-based. An app that runs on a desktop will be different from one that runs on a phone at least because the operating system's visual setup has noteably different graphical elements and ways of interacting with them. Another cause for difference is that different platforms often are written in different programming languages, so apps that are widely available outside of on the web have been developed separately for each platform.

Developing for these platforms requires knowledge of not just the base language, but also GUI programming principles as related to where the app will run.

Outside of the realm of computers has emerged the Internet of Things. This phenomenon is, in a sense, an extenstion of robotics that allows people to connect devices to the Internet that historically have lived exclusively offline.
