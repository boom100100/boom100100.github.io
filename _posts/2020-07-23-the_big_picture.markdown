A very short description of the software development curriculum is that students learn how to write programs that can run locally. Then, students learn to set up a frontend and a backend for a website using common technologies related to Ruby and JavaScript. There is also a strong emphasis on web technologies like RESTful routing and API serving and requesting.

While the bootcamp only has to go so far to teach web development principles, there is more out there. Other ways to present programs include creating platform-specific applications. These are not web-based. An app that runs on a desktop will be different from one that runs on a phone at least because GUIs vary from one OS or platform to the next. Another cause for difference is that different platforms often are written in different programming languages, so apps that are widely available outside of on the web have been developed separately for each platform. (On a side note, even web development must account for variations from one browser, or even from one browser version, to the next.)

Developing for these platforms requires knowledge of not just the base language, but also GUI programming principles as related to where the app will run. Also, Atom isn't the only integrated development environment. It's even possible to find IDEs that are specific to a destination platform.

The realm of computers has even expanded. The Internet of Things is, in a sense, a less functional extension of robotics that allows people to put online devices that historically have lived exclusively offline. IoT devices send and receive data over the Internet.

Developers can have more flexibility when working in the realm of the IoT because its interface can be exclusively online. It may be excessive, and it's definitely limiting to plan that a device that already requires programming also ship with software that is platform-specific. However, any data storage would require infrastructure to support CRUD functionality and persistence, so this would likely require a few steps more than a typical web full stack.
