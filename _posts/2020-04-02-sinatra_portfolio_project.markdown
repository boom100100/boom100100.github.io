It's often easier to remember where an essential piece of information related to a task is is than it is to remember every detail about that piece of information. Even more difficult is learning the details of work that someone else left behind. These challenges are why every professional organization needs a system to help them keep track of what it needs to get done. 

The Technical Support Network ticketing system is a simple tool for differentiating roles and allocating work. It takes on the challenges of providing a place where professionals can store what they need to know about each task they must complete. The system also shows a clear relationship between professionals and their customers, and it clearly shows a task's status. Lastly, this system  limits access to users where appropriate.

There are two common models for work-tracking systems that this project may have become: a project-planning system and a task-tracking system. The former type often associates many tasks with each other in a bundle that makes up a single project. This likely includes features that allow sharing a project, and it often declines to specify a customer that will be the recipient of the project because its footprint is likely big enough to be difficult to assign to a single contact. A project-planning system is often used to manage feature development.

The latter type is a more diffuse set of tasks. The one-time tasks of a task-tracking system are often at least on the verge of emergency status, so their footprint can only be calculated once the task becomes necessary. Tasks of this type generally have a shorter expectation for when someone will complete them.

The task-tracking system model is the inspiration for the features of the Technical Support Network. While this project is styled to appeal to IT professionals,
