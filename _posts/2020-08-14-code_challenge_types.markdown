There are three typical formats for coding challenges at interviews that I've come across.

The first is the timed challenge. This challenge is usually packaged as a challenge you do on a web site like HackerRank or CodeSignal. These challenges typically focus on algorithmic problems that may or may not have time constraints attached to them. This one has been more common in my experience.

The second is the take-home challenge. This challenge tends to consist of building an app from scratch. I've seen backend/CLIs, full stack, and frontend-only projects like this. The follow-up interview tends to consist of explaining code and code choices, so it's reflective and can offer insight into technologies to learn. Some companies offer a variety of challenges, and they will even let you try them all. But they will only grade the bare minimum of the requirements they set out to save their resources.

The third is the live code exercise. Being able to think on your toes and remember the overall structure and syntax of a language are key. Collaboration is possible here, and it can even be overwhelming in the sense of an interviewer not giving you enough time to think through a problem before trying to present it in a presumably easier-to-understand way. Just be sure to communicate what you're doing and if you need a minute or two to think, and bring an open mind to explore ideas you haven't encountered. You'll learn what it's like to be in a specific team in interviews like this, and you'll have a better understanding of your ability to perform your knowledge.
