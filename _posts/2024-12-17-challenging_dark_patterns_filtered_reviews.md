Not all features of a website are meant to add positive value. Some features add negative value by attempting to manipulate a user into an action that only benefits the entity that owns the site.

These unethical features are called dark patterns.

## Filtered Reviews

One example of a dark pattern is filtered reviews. Reviews are crowdsourced evaluations of goods and services that users take time to write, and sharing their insights to other users is a promise that site owners should take seriously. Regardless, a company that owns a sales website like an ecommerce platform can pick and choose which reviews to display. They may place limitations like omitting negative reviews or handpicking a few positive reviews for users to see. These limitations mean that before making a purchase, the user isn't able to evaluate all of the cons that other users have already discovered. Users also cannot see (in a more recent review) if any of those cons have been addressed over time.

A savvy user might question the authenticity of reviews, as ones with no clear source may be fake. Using feeds from services like TrustPilot lend legitimacy because of their third-party nature and the resulting lack of control that brands have over their platform. But even TrustPilot reviews can be filtered.

## Challenging Filtered Reviews

There are several ways to challenge the filtered reviews dark pattern. They all involve unarming the filter and revealing the hidden depths of the negative reviews.

### Banish the Practice

The most direct way to end this pattern is for the entity to stop using it. Many companies only see a need to change unethical behavior when it impacts their bottom line or becomes illegal.

It's worth noting that third-party sites for reviews can also, to some degree, control how an ecommerce site uses their platform. But while they can make it part of their operating principle to have companies use the platform as transparently as possible, that limits both their appeal to those companies and their flexibility.

### Write negative commentary in a 5-star review

Some filters only omit reviews with a certain rating value. Putting overwhelmingly bad commentary in a highly rated review would really muddy the signal that the review offers to the site owner. But the user would have access to more decision-critical information.

Since companies do read reviews for their products, they would definitely notice a disparate commentary. This strategy would likely cause the site owner to respond by hand-picking reviews or accepting the expectation that their customers get to have a voice.

## Outlook

Ultimately, a sales website isn't the only place where a user might want to share their observations about a product. LinkedIn, X, and Facebook are three of many avenues that offer a more open venue for sharing displeasure about a company's goods and services. Accepting that alternative is a scenario where it's hard to find complete and honest information, but it's the only option we can be sure is available.
